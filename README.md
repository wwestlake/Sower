# 🌾 Sower: A DSP Workbench

**Sower is not a DAW**—it is a sound design lab.  
A place where audio is shaped, layered, and forged into something new.

Built with JUCE and C++, Sower provides a modular, stack-based interface for crafting sound effects, manipulating signals, and designing audio for games, music, film, and experimental projects. From bursty glitch textures to polished layers of modulation, Sower gives you the tools to sculpt sound in a flexible and focused environment.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎛️ **Modular DSP Chain Building**  
  Stack effects like Bitcrush, EQ, Delay, or Spectral Blur—reorder, group, tweak, export.

- 🎙️ **Signal Generators**  
  Build sonic elements from scratch using sine waves, bursts, noise, or composite generator trees.

- 📁 **WAV In, WAV Out**  
  Sower works with uncompressed audio to avoid complexity and maximize quality.

- 🧰 **Export to REAPER Plugin**  
  Design effects in Sower, then load them as runtime chains in REAPER using a dedicated lightweight plugin.

- 🧠 **Save & Share Chains**  
  Reuse effect stacks and generator compositions across projects or share with collaborators.

## 🚧 What Sower Is Not

- ❌ It is not a DAW  
- ❌ No MIDI sequencing  
- ❌ No multitrack mixing  
- ❌ No MP3 or compressed audio support

Sower is **laser-focused** on sound shaping and creative DSP—not production management.
